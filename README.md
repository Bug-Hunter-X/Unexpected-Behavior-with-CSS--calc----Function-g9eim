# CSS `calc()` Issues
This repository demonstrates some uncommon issues that can arise when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `bug.css` file shows examples of these issues, while `bugSolution.css` provides solutions and workarounds.

**Issues Demonstrated:**

* Inconsistent units in `calc()` expressions
* Complex nested `calc()` expressions
* Browser compatibility differences

**Solutions:**

* Ensure consistent units throughout your `calc()` expressions.
* Simplify complex `calc()` expressions or break them down into smaller, more manageable calculations.
* Use vendor prefixes where necessary to ensure broader browser support.
* Consider using alternative layout techniques (e.g., flexbox or grid) if `calc()` proves too problematic.

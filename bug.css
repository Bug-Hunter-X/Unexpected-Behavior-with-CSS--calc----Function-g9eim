The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if the units are inconsistent or if the calculation is too complex.  For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` might not work as expected if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Another issue can occur when using nested `calc()` functions, which can sometimes cause parsing errors depending on browser compatibility.  Finally, older browsers may have limited support for certain `calc()` features.
